# Refactorisation rules

- Always **prefer small changes** to a large project involving several files: **boy scout rule**.
- Use POO and SOLID principles
- Only add JSDoc at the top of the component or the tool(if its a *.ts file).
- Avoid "any" type and undefined. Use unknown or null with guard type.
- Use Async/await and avoid .then
- Use try/catch
- Remove all comments who was write in french.
