We use **clean architecture** and **Domain-Driven Development** (DDD) when its possible in our project because we are some legacy code.
Maintain a **clear separation of concerns** between different architectural layers.

## SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Prinple (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DSP)
